# Peer-2-Pocket Monsters

A browser based, peer-to-peer monster battle simulator. On the website, players can select characters and connect to one another directly to play. Players then take turns selecting moves in an attempt to bring their opponentâ€™s health to 0 HP. There are a variety of monsters to choose from, each with their own set of moves and specializations. While battling, players can also use a chat feature to send messages back and forth. The app is fully mobile responsive and works across all platforms.
