# Peer-2-Pocket Monsters

A browser based, peer-to-peer monster battle simulator. On the website, players can select characters and connect to one another directly to play. Players then take turns selecting moves in an attempt to bring their opponentâ€™s health to 0 HP. There are a variety of monsters to choose from, each with their own set of moves and specializations. While battling, players can also use a chat feature to send messages back and forth. The app is fully mobile responsive and works across all platforms. Within my team for the project, I was the primary front-end designer, gameplay designer, and systems architect. I also advised other group members on the usage of the PeerJS library and how to incorporate it into their code.  
(If you would like to test the game alone, simply open the site in two tabs!)
